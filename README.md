# Portfolio Project

This is a portfolio project that showcases my work and services, and provides a way for people to contact me. The project is divided into two main parts: the client-side and the server-side.

## Client-Side

The client-side of the portfolio is built with React and Vite. It includes the following pages:

- **Home**: The landing page of the portfolio.
- **Projects**: A showcase of my projects.
- **Services**: A list of services I offer.
- **Contact**: A page where visitors can send me a message.

Currently, the data for these pages is stored in the `data.jsx` file. The focus at the moment is on enhancing the user experience on the client-side.

You can find more details about the client-side in its [README](client-side/README.md).

## Server-Side

The server-side of the portfolio is planned to be built with Payload CMS, a JavaScript and TypeScript-based headless CMS. This will provide a backend for the app, allowing me to easily update the content of the portfolio without having to modify the code. However, the server-side is still under construction.

You can find more details about the server-side in its [README](server-side/README.md).
