# Portfolio Project

This portfolio project is built with React and Vite, showcasing my work and services while providing a way for people to contact me.

## Features

The portfolio includes the following pages:

- **Home**: The landing page of the portfolio.
- **Projects**: A showcase of my projects.
- **Services**: A list of services I offer.
- **Contact**: A page where visitors can send me a message.

Currently, the data for these pages is stored in the `data.jsx` file.

## Future Plans

In the future, I plan to use Payload CMS, a JavaScript and TypeScript-based headless CMS, to provide a backend for the app. This will allow me to easily update the content of the portfolio without having to modify the code.
